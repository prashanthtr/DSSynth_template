Test case reports:

Filenames and Classnames
  - To change the filename in config file, user needs to rename the file and the class name inside the file (that it exports).
  - To change filename myPop_001 to myPop_002, then the user would change in 
  1) config_file, 2) rename to myPop_002 3) and make the name of the class inside file to myPop_002. 

Multipe formats generaton: 
 - No error for multiple formats (Done)

Fixed and variable parameters (Done)
 - Fields need to be there, can be empty
 - Even if there are no fixedparams, the field and the structure should still be there (for now)
            {
            "user_doc": "rate of Pop sounds",
            "synth_pname": "rate_exp",
            "synth_val": 0.5,
            "synth_units": "norm"
            }

- Chaning number of chunks (done)
 - The chunk durations are Floored. If the user specifies chunks 3 seconds in a total sound duration of 4 seconds, it produces 1 sound of 3 seconds

Changing every single parameter (Testing for natural and norm?)
 - Code Throws error when norm values are greater than 1
